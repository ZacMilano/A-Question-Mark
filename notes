Convolution
	go over image with matrix filters for feature detection
	Depth
		number of filters used
	Stride
		number of pixels we move the filter over on each iteration over the image
	Padding
		put zeros around image
		Narrow convolution
			don't use padding
		Wide convolution
			use padding
Non-Linearity function
	map this function over the matrix after each convolution step
Pooling
	reduces size of the matrix but retains important info
	ex: avg, max, sum
	more manageable / reduce overfitting
Fully connected layer
	every neuron in previous layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer
	for classification purposes
	combines all of the stuff we have learned via convolution and pooling, might be better!
Backpropagation / Training
	minimize entropy using a random starting filter
