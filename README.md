CSCI-B351 Final project for Jacob Adley, Zac Monroe, and Zunaeed Salahuddin

Our goal is to make several AI implementations that classify handwritten
characters (letters and digits) into proper classes. We are using the [EMNIST
data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373), a labeled dataset containing >700,000
training examples.
